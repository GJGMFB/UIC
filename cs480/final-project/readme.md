# Chicago Public Library Metrics Program

Program usage: You can "visit" Chicago's libraries and see which ones have the most/least visitors of all time. Additionally you can "start a WiFi session" or "computer session" at a particular library and see how many sessions there were for a chosen month.

Note about data: The library data was relatively messy so I had to modify a few things with Excel so that it would be easy to import into a database. Some libraries were missing between datasets, so I removed those. Chicago's data portal team decided to give a monthly granularity for these datasets, so it makes the program a little boring to use.

Note about database-creator program: It will drop tables and constraints at the start to create a fresh database.
